Let M, N denote sets.
Let A, B denote classes.

Axiom. M is setsized.
Axiom. Let x be an element of M. x is setsized.

Axiom SubclassOfSet. Assume for any object x such that x is an element of A
  x is an element of M. Then A is a set.

Axiom Pair. Let x,y be setsized objects. (x, y) is setsized.

Axiom Replacement. Let f be a function. Let M be a set. Assume Dom(f) = M.
  Let x be an element of M. Then f(x) is setsized.
